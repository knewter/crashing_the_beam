## Crashing The BEAM

These are some examples of failure modes of the BEAM.  I'd love to collect more
over time.  For now, run any of the examples with:

```sh
mix run examples/filling_the_atom_table.exs
```

...for instance, to see that particular failure mode in action.  WARNING: Some
of them will do awful things to your computer and make it asplode.
